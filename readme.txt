====== ======

This is a very simple plugin to add all javascript files to the footer section of your website.
It works simply by activating the plugin and deactivating the plugin.
Regular updates will follow. This is my first plugin. 
On later updates we will be able to exclude certain javascript files from being moved to the footer.
So keep in mind to have the latest version of this Simple Move Javascript To Footer plugin.
